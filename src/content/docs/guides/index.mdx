Welcome to the documentation of the **Next-Generation eXtensible Email Builder** or shorter **NGB Email Builder**.

**NGB Email Builder** is an Angular library that contains a bunch of abstract classes, [services](/guides/services/), [directives](/guides/directives/), [pipes](/guides/pipes/), and other Angular tools that you can use to create your own email builder.

You need to have a basic understanding of Angular to use this library. If you don't know Angular, you can learn it [here](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart). This library contains many features so it might be a bit overwhelming at first.&#x20;

But don't worry, this documentation will help you to get started.
